+ p1c2l10: what do you do with cyclic datastructrures?
+ p2c1l?: "internal representation of Agda": a subset of Agda, I
  guess?
+ p2c1l?: Same place: I don't understand this sentence. How is
  distinguishing between complex and simple values related to
  "suspended compuation", "weak head normal form", and the
  corresponding Agda program??
+ p2c2l?: "to the function" := "to the translated function" - also in
  the code, please show in some way that the resulting "foo" is not
  the same as the original "foo" (the first expects a value, the
  second a pointer).
+ p5c1l-4/-1: These environments and the drop / dup operations are a
  bit hard to grasp.
+ p5c2l?: "”fetch x14 [2] ; λΓ x40 →” extends the owned":
  + 1: what is the "[2]" doing? This seems to be the first use.
  + 2: is any of the names (x14, [2], x40) the name of the "resource
    token"?
+ p5c2l?: "our implementation of drop is unsatisfactory": this comes a
  bit too suddenly: wait with saying that until you have described the
  implementation.
+ p7c1l1: "we can almost always specialize drop": now I'm confused:
  you just said your implementation is unsatisfactory, now it sounds
  like it is not.
+ p7c2l?: Same place: what if the constructor has more than two arguments?
+ p9c1l?: "Boquist, U. (1999)" - how to get it (lacks venue / link /
  report number etc.)
(+ p10c1: How come "Perceus for ocaml" appears twice: once under Pinto
  and once under Turk? Aha - that was your comment in the mail!)
