This is an attempt to formalize our variant of the Perceus algorithm (src/Compiler/Grin/Perceus.hs). See, latex/report.pdf for the current rules. We have modelled some of the rules in Formalize.MiniGrin. However, the rules are not identical as we use different datatypes and syntax representation that are easier to reason about. 

We have to dependencies two dependencies, agda2hs and scope, that need to be installed manually. These are available at [github.com/agda/agda2hs](https://github.com/agda/agda2hs) and [github.com/jespercockx/scope](https://github.com/jespercockx/scope), respectively. We take inspiration from [github.com/jespercockx/agda-core](https://github.com/jespercockx/agda-core).
